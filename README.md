# Stream2Disk
Glad you made it here! Enjoy.
## Use Case:
Streaming has shifted to using staggered .m3u8 playlists wherein the video file is chopped into many short mini files, if you will. These .m3u8 files cannot be directly downloaded to disk using conventional methods. You can still however stream the .m3u8 file using any software with network streaming capabilities such as VLC, but the stream will most likely be choppy and often will drop. 

Stream2Disk is a GUI wrapper that uses ffmpeg streaming capability. Meaning that the video file being streamed will be saved to disk at a much much faster rate. The GUI provides simple library management too to keep track of downloaded streams.
